## About The Project

Managing environment variables in AWS Elastic Beanstalk can be tiresome, especially when a project contains many of them. Whenever EB Environment is terminated, there is no way to simply persist or move them to another EB Environment. That's where this script comes in handy. It parses envs from a choosen file and injects them to the prepared one-liner. This way, envs for each EB Environment can be kept as a separate file, and all that is needed to do whenever they change is to run this script.
